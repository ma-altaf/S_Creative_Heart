# S.Creative Heart Gallery Website (development code)

Gallery website to display previous works of Mauritian freelance artist Shifa.

> Link to official website: <https://screativeheart.web.app/>

## What I did

-   Created a responsive website using **HTML**, **CSS(SCSS)** and **JavaScript**.
-   Used animation library **GSAP** (core, ScrollTrigger) for the front-end.
-   Implemented **Firebase Firestore** as the database to store the links to the images.
-   Used **ImageKit.io** to store and deliver the image as webp and dynamically reduced to the appropriate size for the user screen to reduce data consumption and improve speed of loading the content.
-   Implemented momentum scrolling using [**Smooth Scrollbar**](https://github.com/idiotWu/smooth-scrollbar) library.
-   Used **Preload JS** library to monitor the loading of the initial images during the loading screen.

```
NOTE: I did not know how to use git and GitHub at that time,
so there is only one large commit with the whole website ðŸ˜….

##### Approximate development time frame: November â€“ December 2021
